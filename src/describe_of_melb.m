%**Brief English Summary:**

1. **Concept of the Mel Frequency Scale**  
   Human hearing is **more sensitive** to frequency changes in the **low-frequency** range and **less sensitive** in the **high-frequency** range. The Mel scale reflects this by using a **mixed linear-log** approach for frequency mapping.

2. **Construction of Triangular Filter Banks**  
   The function `melb.m` (or `melfb.m`) places **overlapping triangular filters** from 0 up to the Nyquist frequency. The center frequencies of these filters are distributed according to the Mel scale, resulting in **more filters in lower frequencies** and **wider filters in higher frequencies**.

3. **Wrapping from Linear to Mel Frequency**  
   By mapping linear frequencies to the Mel scale and determining their positions on the FFT frequency axis, the filter bank achieves **high resolution** in the low-frequency region and **compression** in the high-frequency region, aligning more closely with human auditory perception.

4. **Impact on Speech Features**  
   - More detail is preserved in low-frequency regions (where formants typically lie).  
   - High-frequency regions are compressed, reducing sensitivity to less critical details.  
   - Subsequent **log** and **DCT** operations yield **MFCCs**, whose key advantage is derived from this Mel-scale transformation for better alignment with human hearing.

5. **Why the Filter Peaks Might Be 2**  
   Some implementations set the filter amplitude to 2 at the center frequency as a normalization choice. It does not affect the validity of the final MFCCs, since the **log + DCT** steps largely mitigate absolute scaling differences.
